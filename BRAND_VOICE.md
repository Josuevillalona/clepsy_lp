# Clepsy — Brand Voice & Messaging Guide

> This document defines how Clepsy speaks across every touchpoint — landing page, app UI, social media, emails, App Store listing, and beyond.

---

## Core Message (Commander's Intent)

If someone remembers **one thing** about Clepsy, it should be this:

> **"Trade your scroll time for time that builds something real."**

This is the lens every piece of copy passes through. We don't sell blocking. We sell what the blocked time *turns into*.

---

## Brand Positioning

### What we are
A time-trading system that turns mindless scrolling into skills, habits, and growth.

### What we are NOT
- Not a screen time reminder you'll ignore
- Not a digital detox that asks you to go cold turkey
- Not a shame-based app that makes you feel guilty
- Not a parental control tool repurposed for adults

### One-liner variations (by context)

| Context | Line |
|---------|------|
| **Elevator pitch** | Clepsy blocks social media until you earn screen time through productive apps — so your TikTok hours become Duolingo hours. |
| **App Store subtitle** | Trade scroll time for real skills. |
| **Social media bio** | What if your screen time actually built something? |
| **Press/PR** | Clepsy is an iOS app that turns social media addiction into a self-improvement engine through time-trading. |

---

## Voice Principles

### 1. Sell the transformation, not the mechanism
We don't lead with "we block apps." We lead with what happens when those hours go somewhere better.

| Don't say | Say instead |
|-----------|------------|
| "Block social media apps" | "Free up the hours you didn't know you had" |
| "Earn screen time through productive apps" | "30 minutes of reading earns 30 minutes of scrolling — but after a week, you might not want the scroll time back" |
| "iOS-enforced restrictions" | "Restrictions you can't cheat — because the whole point is that you can't" |
| "Smart time tracking" | "Open Kindle at lunch. Close it 15 minutes later. 15 minutes of TikTok just appeared in your balance." |

### 2. Make it concrete, always
Every claim should be something you can *picture*. If you can't see it, rewrite it.

| Abstract (avoid) | Concrete (use) |
|-------------------|----------------|
| "Save time" | "Get back 3.5 hours every week" |
| "Be more productive" | "Read 52 books this year" |
| "Improve your habits" | "Build a daily meditation practice that actually sticks" |
| "Digital wellbeing" | "Stop opening Instagram at 10 PM and closing it at midnight" |
| "Reduce screen time" | "Turn 182 hours of scrolling into conversational Spanish" |

### 3. Empathize, don't lecture
We've all been there. We built Clepsy because *we* couldn't stop scrolling. The tone is "I get it" — never "you should know better."

| Lecturing (avoid) | Empathetic (use) |
|--------------------|------------------|
| "Social media is bad for you" | "You already know you scroll too much. You don't need another article telling you that." |
| "You need to be more disciplined" | "It's not a willpower problem. The apps are designed to win." |
| "Stop wasting your time" | "You didn't mean to open TikTok again. Clepsy makes sure you don't have to rely on willpower." |
| "You're addicted to your phone" | "It's 11:47 PM. You opened Instagram 'for a second' at 10:15. Sound familiar?" |

### 4. Be specific, not superlative
No "best," "ultimate," "revolutionary," or "world-class." Specificity is more persuasive than adjectives.

| Superlative (avoid) | Specific (use) |
|----------------------|----------------|
| "The best screen time app" | "The only screen time app you can't cheat" |
| "Revolutionary approach" | "A system where reading for 20 minutes unlocks 20 minutes of Instagram" |
| "Ultimate productivity tool" | "Powered by the same API iOS uses — you literally can't bypass it" |

### 5. Warmth through personality, not emojis
Clepsy (the mascot) is patient, encouraging, and celebratory. The brand voice mirrors this: we're a friend who believes in you, not a corporate app.

| Cold (avoid) | Warm (use) |
|--------------|-----------|
| "Feature: Daily Reset" | "Every morning is a clean slate. Midnight hits, your balance resets, and you start fresh." |
| "Achievement unlocked" | "Throwing confetti — you just hit a 7-day streak." |
| "Notification: Time expired" | "That's a wrap for today. You earned every minute." |

## The Compound Effect — Make It Personal, Make It Visceral

Our most powerful messaging tool isn't a stat — it's a **gut punch**. One number that makes someone feel the weight of their scrolling. Not hours, not books, not sessions. *Weeks of their life.*

### The "weeks of your life" framing

Raw hours are abstract. "1,095 hours" doesn't land. But **"6.5 weeks of your life, every year, just scrolling"** — that hits. The rule: convert time into the unit that feels most visceral. Weeks-of-life works because everyone understands what a week *feels* like.

### Make it theirs, not ours

Generic stats ("the average person scrolls 3.5 hours") are ignorable. Personalized numbers aren't. When someone picks *their own* daily hours and sees *their own* weeks disappearing, it stops being a statistic and becomes a mirror. Always prefer interactive/personalized framing over static claims.

### One number, not many

**Anti-pattern:** Showing multiple stat cards (books/year, Duolingo sessions, meditation hours) feels like a spreadsheet. Too many numbers compete for attention and none of them land.

**Pattern:** One visceral number (weeks of your life) → one concrete sentence showing what it could become. The single number creates the emotional opening. The sentence fills it with possibility.

### Clepsy's role in the compound effect

Clepsy is the **consistency engine**. The hardest part of learning a language isn't the learning — it's opening Duolingo instead of TikTok on day 37 when you don't feel like it. Clepsy removes that daily decision. The compounding happens naturally when you show up every day.

**Important framing rule:** We don't claim Clepsy teaches skills or creates outcomes. We show the math of what small daily redirections build, and position Clepsy as the system that makes showing up automatic. The aspiration is the hook. The consistency is the product promise.

### Always frame as 1:1 trade

Clepsy is a 1:1 time trade: earn 20 minutes of reading, unlock 20 minutes of scrolling. **Never frame as percentages** (10%, 25%, 50% of screen time) — it doesn't match the product and confuses people. The simplicity of "minute for minute" is the whole appeal.

### The math (reference)

| Input | Output | The surprise |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 hr/day scrolling | 2.2 weeks of your life/year | Over two full weeks, gone |
| 3 hrs/day scrolling | 6.5 weeks of your life/year | A month and a half, every year |
| 16 min/day redirected | 100 hours/year | Less than one scroll session traded |
| 30 min/day on Kindle | 30+ books a year | That's one scroll session traded |

### How to use this

- **Landing page:** Personalized calculator — user picks their hours, sees weeks-of-life gut punch + one concrete what-if sentence
- **Social media:** Lead with the visceral framing — "3 hours a day = 6.5 weeks of your life, every year"
- **Email sequences:** Each email zooms into one transformation (the language one, the reading one, the meditation one)
- **App Store screenshots:** "How many hours do you scroll? That's X weeks of your life."
- **Onboarding:** Show the user *their own* projection based on their selected apps
- **Ads:** Lead with the weeks framing, reveal what it could become in one sentence

### Key phrases

- "X weeks of your life. Every year. Just scrolling."
- "You already have the time."
- "You're already spending those minutes. They're just going to TikTok."
- "The bar isn't 10,000 hours. It's 16 minutes a day and not quitting."
- "The hardest part isn't the learning. It's opening Duolingo instead of TikTok on day 37."
- "Clepsy makes sure you show up. The compounding does the rest."

## Emotional Scenes (Use Across Channels)

These are pre-written "recognition moments" — scenes that make the reader think *"that's me."* Use them in ads, landing pages, emails, and social.

### The Late Night Scroll
> It's 11:47 PM. You opened Instagram "for a second" at 10:15. Your alarm is set for 6 AM. You know you should stop. You keep scrolling. Tomorrow you'll say "never again." Tomorrow you'll do the same thing.

### The Ignore Button
> You set a 30-minute Screen Time limit. It lasted three days. Then you hit "Ignore for today." Then "Ignore for today" became every day. The limit is still there. You haven't seen it in months.

### The Deleted App
> You deleted TikTok on Sunday. You reinstalled it on Tuesday. You deleted it again on Thursday. By Saturday it was back. You don't need more willpower. You need a system you can't cheat.

### The Lost Afternoon
> You sat down to study at 2 PM. You opened Reddit "for a quick break." It's 4:30. The assignment is untouched. You're not lazy — you just lost a fight against an app designed by 500 engineers to keep you there.

## Headline Formulas

Reusable patterns for any channel:

| "[Small number] is enough to [surprising outcome]" | "100 hours is enough to pick up a new language" |
| "The only [category] that [unexpected quality]." | "The only screen time app you can't cheat." |
| "The bar isn't [high]. It's [low]." | "The bar isn't 10,000 hours. It's 16 minutes a day and not quitting." |
| "[Duration] of [vice] → [duration] of [virtue]" | "20 min of Instagram → 20 min of Kindle. Every day. Automatically." |
| "You're already [doing X]. It's just going to [wrong place]." | "You're already spending those minutes. They're just going to TikTok." |

## Channel-Specific Guidelines

### App Store
- **Title:** Clepsy — Trade Your Scroll Time
- **Subtitle:** Earn screen time through real habits
- **First description line:** What if every hour on TikTok became an hour of reading? Clepsy blocks social media until you earn screen time through productive apps.

### Social Media Posts
- Lead with the scene or the math, never the feature
- One idea per post — don't explain the whole system
- End with a question or the compounding payoff, not a CTA

### Email (Waitlist Nurture)
- **Welcome:** The core message + their projected transformation
- **Week 1:** The Late Night Scroll scene → "this is why we built Clepsy"
- **Week 2:** The compounding argument with the math table
- **Week 3:** "What would you do with 182 extra hours?" (engagement ask)
- **Pre-launch:** Identity appeal → "for people who are tired of saying 'I'll stop tomorrow'"

### In-App Copy
- Onboarding: Show projected transformation based on their selected apps
- Lock screen: "You've earned X minutes today. Keep going or unlock now."
- Celebration: "That's 7 days straight. Your Kindle streak is longer than most people's gym streak."
- Daily reset: "Clean slate. What will you build today?"

## Brand Etymology (For PR, About Pages, Storytelling)

**Clepsy** comes from *clepsydra* — ancient Greek for "water thief." It was the world's first clock: water slowly dripping, measuring time passing.

We liked the metaphor. Social media is a time thief — minutes dripping away while you watch. Clepsy steals that time back and puts it somewhere better.

## Quick Reference: The SUCCESs Check

Before publishing any copy, ask:

| Principle | Question |
|-----------|----------|
| **Simple** | Is there ONE clear message? Could a stranger get it in 5 seconds? |
| **Unexpected** | Does this surprise or reframe? Or does it sound like every other app? |
| **Concrete** | Can you *picture* it? Is there a specific number, scene, or outcome? |
| **Credible** | Why should someone believe this? Is there math, proof, or honesty? |
| **Emotional** | Does it make you feel something? Recognition, aspiration, or relief? |
| **Stories** | Is there a character, a scene, or a before/after? |

If the answer is "no" to more than two — rewrite.
